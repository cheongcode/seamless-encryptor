**Q: What happens if I lose my key?**
A: You can restore from a password-protected cloud backup if you created one.

**Q: Can I share encrypted files?**
A: You can share `.etcr` files, but recipients need the decryption key. Secure sharing features coming soon.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's the maximum file size?**
A: No hard limit, but performance depends on your system. 100MB+ files may take time on older hardware.

**Q: Can I change encryption methods?**
A: Yes, you can decrypt with one method and re-encrypt with another.

**Q: Is the file format compatible with other tools?**
A: The `.etcr` format is custom but documented. We plan to release format specifications.
