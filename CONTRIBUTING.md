## üìè Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js

- **Use ES6+ features** where appropriate
- **Follow ESLint configuration** (run `npm run lint`)
- **Use meaningful variable names** and function names
- **Add JSDoc comments** for functions and classes
- **Handle errors properly** with try-catch blocks
- **Use async/await** instead of callbacks where possible

#### Example Code Style

```javascript
/**
 * Encrypts a file using the specified algorithm
 * @param {string} filePath - Path to the file to encrypt
 * @param {string} algorithm - Encryption algorithm to use
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Encryption result with success status
 */
async function encryptFile(filePath, algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm') {
  try {
    // Validate input parameters
    if (!filePath || typeof filePath !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Invalid file path provided');
    }

    // Implementation here...
    const result = await performEncryption(filePath, algorithm);
    
    return {
      success: true,
      fileId: result.fileId,
      algorithm: algorithm
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Encryption failed:', error);
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error.message
    };
  }
}
```

### HTML/CSS

- **Use semantic HTML** elements
- **Follow Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- **Ensure accessibility** with proper ARIA labels
- **Test responsive design** on different screen sizes
- **Use consistent spacing** and color schemes

### Security Guidelines

- **Never commit secrets** or API keys
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
- **Follow cryptographic best practices**
- **Handle sensitive data securely** (clear from memory when possible)
- **Use HTTPS** for all external communications

#### Security Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Cryptographic operations use secure algorithms
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and secure

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --grep "encryption"

# Run security audit
npm audit
```

### Writing Tests

- **Write tests for new features** and bug fixes
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Test both success and failure cases**
- **Mock external dependencies** appropriately
- **Keep tests focused** and independent

#### Test Example

```javascript
describe('File Encryption', () => {
  it('should encrypt a file successfully with AES-256-GCM', async () => {
    const testFile = 'test-data/sample.txt';
    const result = await encryptFile(testFile, 'aes-256-gcm');
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.fileId).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.algorithm).toBe('aes-256-gcm');
  });

  it('should handle invalid file paths gracefully', async () => {
    const result = await encryptFile('', 'aes-256-gcm');
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toContain('Invalid file path');
  });
});
```
